# Intro
Started as a Volatility Breakout Strategy trader, evolved into a framework for

a) Technical indicator-based trading strategy back-testing
b) Actual trading based on the trading strategy on Binance

Stopped further investment as it turned out technical indicator-based trading didn't yield desired profit on cryptotrading. The approach is prone to overfitting to past data, which never guarantees future performance.

# Tested Strategies
